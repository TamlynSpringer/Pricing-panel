# Pricing-panel
A mobile-first responsive pricing panel 

The page was made using HTML5 and CSS3, with the intention of creating a mobile-first responsive pricing panel. 
Starter code was obtained from the web development bootcamp course on Udemy by Colt Steele, and the original pricing panel is based off of Travis Williamson's code pen.
